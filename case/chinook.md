## Background
- [Chinook](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) is a sample database being commonly used for demos and testing purposes on multiple products including SQLite. It is an open source project

- The database can be created by running a single [SQL script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnny723/infosys222/master/case/chinook.sql)

- The company Chinook runs a business of selling tracks and albums of music and video online. The database manages all the transactions, and all relevant information related to the products and customers

## Q12: Email provider (8%)

- Write a single SQL statement to generate a list with two columns: Provider and Percentage
  - The first column displays email provider in upper cases (e.g. GMAIL, YAHOO), and the information could be obtained from the email of customer. Email from the same provider with different country code (e.g. yahoo.com, yahoo.de, yahoo.ca) should be considered as part of the same email provider (e.g. YAHOO)
  - The second column displays the percentage of customer with two decimal places
  - Sort the output first by Percentage descendingly, then by Provider ascendingly

## Q13: View the customer (8%)

- Write a single SQL statement to create a view named CustomerView. The view should have three columns: Country, Individual and Company
  - The first column includes all the countries found in the Customer table
  - The second column and the third column display the number of individual and company customers in each country respectively
  - Both second and third columns display only whole number
  - A company customer is defined by the presence of value in the column Company of the Customer table; an individual customer is defined by the absence of value in that same column
  - Sort the output by country ascendingly
  - You are told that you cannot use OUTER JOIN for this particular task

## Q14: We are so lost (8%)

- Write a single SQL statement to create a trigger named UndeleteLostTrack. The objective of this trigger is to cancel the effect of deleting any track from the Track table that associates with LOST the TV show (which could be referenced from the title of an album)
  - The trigger does not stop the deletion; but it cancels its effect by recreating the exact same row or rows of deleted track or tracks
  - The trigger ignores deletion of track that has no association with LOST
